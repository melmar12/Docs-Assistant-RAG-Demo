# Welcome to ABC Corp Engineering

Welcome to the team! We're glad you're here. This doc is your starting point — it won't cover everything, but it'll orient you enough to start asking the right questions.

## Who We Are

ABC Corp builds a B2B SaaS platform that helps companies manage internal operations and reporting. Our customers range from mid-size companies to large enterprises, and they rely on us for things like expense tracking, team management, resource planning, and operational dashboards.

The engineering org is roughly 60 people split across several product squads, a platform team, and an infrastructure team. Each squad owns a slice of the product end-to-end — frontend, backend, and the data layer underneath.

## How We Work

- We run **two-week sprints** with planning on Mondays and retros every other Friday
- Most teams use **Jira** for ticket tracking, though a few teams have experimented with Linear — check with your manager on what your squad uses
- Communication happens primarily in **Slack**. Channels are usually named by team (e.g., `#squad-billing`, `#squad-reporting`)
- Design specs live in **Figma**, and product requirements are usually written up in Confluence (quality varies by team, honestly)
- Code lives in **GitHub**. We'll cover repo structure in a separate doc

## Engineering Values

We don't have a formal values manifesto, but a few things are generally true:

- **Ship incrementally.** Small PRs, frequent deploys. We'd rather see three small changes than one massive diff.
- **Own your services.** If your team builds it, your team runs it. We have on-call rotations, and you'll join yours after your first month or so.
- **Write it down.** Docs aren't perfect, but we try. If you find something wrong or missing, fix it or flag it.
- **Ask questions.** Nobody expects you to know everything on day one. Your onboarding buddy and your manager are your first stops.

## Key People to Know

- **Your manager** — your first point of contact for most things
- **Your onboarding buddy** — someone on your team assigned to help you ramp up during your first few weeks
- **Platform team** — owns shared libraries, CI/CD, and developer tooling. Reach out in `#platform-eng` if you have infra or tooling questions
- **IT/Security** — for laptop issues, access requests, and VPN setup. Use `#it-help` in Slack

## A Few Housekeeping Items

- **Expense policy:** ABC Corp reimburses reasonable work-related expenses. There's a separate doc with the full details, but the short version: meals during travel, ergonomic equipment (with approval), and professional development are generally covered. Submit through the expense system within 30 days. When in doubt, ask Finance before you spend.
- **Working hours:** We're flexible. Most people are online roughly 10am–6pm in their local time zone, but nobody's tracking your hours. Just be available for your team's core meetings and responsive on Slack during the workday.
- **PTO:** Use it. Seriously. Check with your manager on the logistics, but we don't want people burning out.

## What's Next

Your first week has its own playbook doc — take a look at that next. It walks through what to set up, who to meet, and what to expect before you start picking up real work.

If something in these docs is wrong or confusing, that's useful feedback. Let your manager or onboarding buddy know and we'll get it fixed.
