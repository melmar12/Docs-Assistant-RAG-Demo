# Expense Policy for Engineers

This is the engineering-specific supplement to ABC Corp's general expense policy. It covers the things engineers most commonly expense and a few engineering-specific guidelines. For the full company-wide policy, see the main Expense Policy document.

## The Basics

- All expenses must be **work-related and reasonable**
- Submit expenses through the company expense system within **30 days**
- Receipts are required for anything over **$25**
- Your manager approves; Finance reviews and processes reimbursement
- Reimbursement typically shows up within **2–3 payroll cycles**

When in doubt about whether something is expensable, ask your manager or Finance before purchasing.

## Common Engineering Expenses

### Equipment and Ergonomics

You get a company laptop on your first day. Beyond that:

- **Monitors, keyboards, mice** — generally approved up to $500 without needing special approval. If you want something pricier, check with your manager first.
- **Ergonomic chairs and standing desks** — approved with manager sign-off. There's a suggested list from the office team, but you're not limited to it.
- **Headphones** — reimbursable if you need them for meetings or focus work. Keep it reasonable (we're not expensing $800 headphones).
- **Adapters, cables, docks** — just expense them. Nobody's going to question a $30 USB-C hub.

### Software and Subscriptions

Most standard tools are provided company-wide (Slack, GitHub, Jira, etc.). If you need something that isn't already available:

- **IDE licenses** (e.g., JetBrains) — approved. Submit a request through IT for a team license if one doesn't already exist.
- **Personal productivity tools** — case by case. A $10/month app is probably fine; a $50/month tool needs manager approval.
- **AI coding assistants** — the company is evaluating options centrally. Check `#platform-eng` for the current status before purchasing your own subscription.

### Professional Development

- **Conferences** — approved with manager sign-off and reasonable travel costs. Budget is usually one conference per year per engineer, but this varies by team and fiscal year. Plan ahead — last-minute requests are harder to approve.
- **Online courses and certifications** — generally approved if relevant to your role. Pluralsight and O'Reilly subscriptions are available company-wide (check `#it-help` for access).
- **Books** — just expense them. Technical books related to your work are always fine.

### Meals and Team Events

- **Team lunches and dinners** — expensable when it's a team activity. The most senior person present usually picks up the tab and expenses it.
- **Meals during on-call incidents** — if you're actively responding to a P1 at dinner time, expense your meal. No one's going to argue with that.
- **First-week meals** — your first week, meals with your onboarding buddy or team are generally covered. Don't overthink it.
- **Coffee** — daily coffee runs are not expensable (sorry). Coffee for a candidate interview or a client meeting is fine.

### Travel

Engineering travel is usually for:

- Company offsites (1–2 per year)
- Conferences
- Visiting other office locations

Book through the company's preferred travel tool when possible. Economy airfare, reasonable hotels. Check the general expense policy for the full travel guidelines.

## What's NOT Expensable

- Personal software or subscriptions unrelated to work
- Home office furniture beyond ergonomic essentials (no, you cannot expense a couch)
- Daily commute costs
- Alcohol beyond what's part of a reasonable team dinner
- Anything you wouldn't feel comfortable explaining to Finance

## How to Submit

1. Log into the expense system (link is in the `#finance` Slack channel topic)
2. Create a new expense report
3. Upload receipts and add descriptions — be specific enough that Finance doesn't have to guess ("Team lunch - 5 people, sprint kickoff" is better than "food")
4. Submit for manager approval

If you miss the 30-day window, you can still submit with an explanation, but it may be delayed or require additional approval. Just try not to make it a habit.

## Questions?

- Expense system issues → `#finance` in Slack
- "Can I expense X?" → Ask your manager first, or post in `#engineering-general` if it's a common question
- Policy questions → Finance team
